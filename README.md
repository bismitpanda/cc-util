# cc-util

CLI to switch between Claude Code accounts without logging in again.

Snapshots the active OAuth credentials, then restores them when you switch. Saved under `~/.cc-util/accounts/`.

> **macOS is not supported yet.** Claude Code stores its OAuth credentials in the macOS Keychain there instead of `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, and cc-util only reads/writes that file. Linux and Windows are unaffected — Claude Code uses `.credentials.json` on both.

## Install

### One-liner (recommended)

Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bismitpanda/cc-util/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bismitpanda/cc-util/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Re-running either script upgrades both binaries (same install path). `ccu` is the same CLI as `cc-util`. Defaults:

| Platform | Install location                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux    | `~/.local/bin/cc-util` and `~/.local/bin/ccu`                            |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\cc-util\cc-util.exe` and `ccu.exe`              |

Optional env overrides: `CC_SWITCH_VERSION` (e.g. `v1.1.1`), `CC_SWITCH_INSTALL_DIR`.

### Manual / other

Download a prebuilt binary from the
[latest release](https://github.com/bismitpanda/cc-util/releases/latest)
(Linux and Windows, amd64/arm64).

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/bismitpanda/cc-util@latest
```

Or from a local clone:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) -X main.bin=cc-util" -o cc-util .
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) -X main.bin=ccu" -o ccu .
```

`main.bin` is the name printed in help and error messages. It defaults to `cc-util` when unset.

Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`). Go is only needed for `go install` / local builds.

| `cc-util switch rename [old] [new]` | Rename a saved account                                |
| `cc-util switch list`               | List saved accounts                                   |
| `cc-util switch history`            | Show account switch history                           |
| `cc-util switch whoami`             | Show the active account                               |
| `cc-util switch status`             | Show credential validity and expiry                   |
| `cc-util switch usage [name]`       | Show rate-limit usage (all accounts, or a named one)  |
| `cc-util switch tokens [name]`      | Show Claude Code token usage by account (local JSONL) |
| `cc-util completion <shell>`        | Print a completion script for Bash, Fish, or Zsh      |
| `cc-util help`                      | Show help                                             |

`tokens` attributes usage from Claude Code project JSONL logs using `~/.cc-util/switches.jsonl`. It also shows cumulative active time per account from that switch history (last segment runs until now). Pass `--spend` for estimated USD cost, or `-A` / `--active` for the active account only.

Omit `[name]` in an interactive terminal and you'll get a prompt.

## Shell completion

Choose your shell:

### Zsh

Create a completion directory and add it to `fpath`:

```bash
completion_dir="${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zfunc"
mkdir -p "$completion_dir"
cc-util completion zsh > "$completion_dir/_cc-util"
```

Add this before `compinit` in `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc`:

```zsh
fpath=("${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zfunc" $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

With Oh My Zsh, use its custom completion directory instead; it is already
added to `fpath` and is kept separate from framework updates:

```zsh
completion_dir="${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/completions"
mkdir -p "$completion_dir"
cc-util completion zsh > "$completion_dir/_cc-util"
```

Restart Zsh with `exec zsh`.

### Bash

Install
[bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) first, then write
the script to its per-user completion directory:

```bash
completion_dir="${BASH_COMPLETION_USER_DIR:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/bash-completion}/completions"
mkdir -p "$completion_dir"
cc-util completion bash > "$completion_dir/cc-util"
exec bash
```

### Fish

```fish
set -q XDG_CONFIG_HOME; or set XDG_CONFIG_HOME "$HOME/.config"
set completion_dir "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/completions"
mkdir -p "$completion_dir"
cc-util completion fish > "$completion_dir/cc-util.fish"
exec fish
```

## First-time setup

```bash
claude auth login          # account A
cc-util switch save personal

claude auth logout
claude auth login          # account B
cc-util switch save work

cc-util switch use personal     # switch without another browser login
cc-util switch use work
```

## How it works

Each save stores `oauthAccount` (from `~/.claude.json`) and `claudeAiOauth` (from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json` if set) as `~/.cc-util/accounts/<name>.json`.

`sync` writes the current live credentials back into the active account's snapshot (errors if the active account isn't saved yet).

`use` syncs the outgoing account's snapshot first (when it matches a saved account), then writes the target snapshot into the active Claude Code config files. Each successful switch appends a line to `~/.cc-util/switches.jsonl` (`ts`, `from`, `to`).

`disable` marks a snapshot as disabled without deleting it — useful when a subscription is paused or expired and API calls return 403. Disabled accounts stay in `list` (marked) but are skipped by `usage`/`use`/`status` until `enable`.

`tokens` reads Claude Code usage from `~/.claude/projects/` (and `~/.config/claude/projects/`), then attributes each entry to whichever account was active at that timestamp per the switch log. `--spend` estimates USD from model pricing (or transcript `costUSD` when present).

Account snapshots are stored with mode `0600`; `~/.cc-util/` and `accounts/` are `0700`.
